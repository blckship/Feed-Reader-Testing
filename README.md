# &#x1f15f;roject Overview
#### Udacity nanodegree

##### Feed Reader Testing
For this project, you are given a web application that reads RSS feeds.
And with the help of  [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) you'll test if the Javascript is working properly.

## &#x1F539; &#x1f166;hy this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.




## &#x1F539; &#x1f166;hat did I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## &#x1F539; &#x1f163;ests That Were Implemented
&#x1F530; Tests for allfeeds has been defined and that it is not empty
&#x1F530; Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
&#x1F530; Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty
&#x1F530; Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
&#x1F530; Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears
&#x1F530; Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container
&#x1F530; Tests to see if two entries are not equal

## &#x1F539; &#x1f153;o you want  to try yourself?

1. Download repository from [click here](https://github.com/Ul1ra/FeedReader).
2. open file `app.js`.
3. Explore the Jasmine spec file in `feedreader.js`.
    * This is the file in which you'll be writing your tests
    * Read all code comments and complete all the ToDo's.
    * Review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io) if needed.

important info:

 * No test should be dependent on the results of another
 * Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested
 * Error handling should be implemented for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access
 * When complete, all of your tests should pass.
